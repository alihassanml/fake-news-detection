## Fake News Detection using Machine Learning ##

**Description:**
This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes Python and several libraries for data manipulation, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning.

**Libraries Used:**
- **pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy:** Provides support for mathematical functions and operations on arrays.
- **matplotlib:** A plotting library used for data visualization.
- **re:** Offers support for regular expressions, helpful for text preprocessing.
- **seaborn:** Works alongside matplotlib for enhanced data visualization.
- **nltk:** Natural Language Toolkit, used for text processing tasks such as stopword removal and stemming.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn):**
  - **TfidfTransformer and TfidfVectorizer:** Used for feature extraction from text data using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
  - **train_test_split:** For splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - **LogisticRegression:** Implements logistic regression, a commonly used classification algorithm.
  - **accuracy_score:** Calculates the accuracy of the model.

**Project Workflow:**
1. **Data Loading:** The project likely starts with loading a dataset containing both real and fake news articles.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Text Cleaning: Removing unnecessary characters, special symbols, and URLs.
   - Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
   - Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words that do not carry significant meaning.
   - Stemming: Reducing words to their root form to normalize the text.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Using TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical vectors.
4. **Model Training:** Splitting the data into training and testing sets, then training a logistic regression model on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the trained model's performance using accuracy metrics on the testing set.
6. **Deployment:** After successful evaluation, the model can be deployed to predict fake news on new data.

**GitHub Repository:**
The GitHub repository for this project is available at [fake-news-detection](https://github.com/alihassanml/fake-news-detection.git). It contains the project code, dataset (if applicable), and documentation to replicate and understand the implementation.

**Note:**
Ensure that the README.md file in your GitHub repository provides clear instructions on how to run the code, install dependencies, and understand the project structure.
